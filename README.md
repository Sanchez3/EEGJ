EEGJ
====

New Media Team Project for team Codename Riri, "Electroencephalogram Jockey," or EEGJ.

### Overview

"EEGJ: An immersive audio/visual experience. Created using EEG technology to turn the rhythms of your heart and mind into music for the danceï¬‚oor! EEGJ puts you in the DJ booth, allowing you to create personal beats and visuals using data generated from your brain, heart, and hands."

EEGJ was on exhibit at the 2014 Imagine RIT event at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Brain data gathered from a user through a hacked MindFlex EEG reader is used to modulate the parameters of a unique, generative MIDI soundscape. Auxiliary pressure sensors are used to control audio filters as well. All user input is used to affect the visual display, which includes turntables, speakers, graphs, and even a game to guide users through the experience.
